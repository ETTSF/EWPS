        apple, be sure to measure around it.

        when snug.

        that point. Keep the tape snug and
        adjust to be sure it is parallel to the

The rule of thumb is to cover 80% of your seat.'

    of the tape measure at the top of the
    waistband, directly over the zipper.
    Pull the tape measure through the legs
    to the corresponding point at the rear
